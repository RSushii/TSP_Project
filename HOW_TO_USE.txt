If you already have preset data (x,y coordinate .txt files) skip to step 3.

1.  Run generateRandom.exe with ./generateRandom.exe or if using terminal: generateRandom.exe

2.  This will prompt you for the number of n cities to create, the gridsize, seed, and the filename (do not add .txt)
        This will create a .txt file showing all of the x,y coordinates of the cities and it will also generate a SVG file
        showing a visual of all the cities and the connections between them.

3.  Run one of the three TSP algorithms. (NOTE: For n cities > 12, runtime will be long and isn't feasable after ~13)
        To run these, run:
        (BRUTE FORCE) ./bruteForce.exe filename.txt OR bruteForce.exe filename.txt
        (GREEDY) ./greedyTSP.exe filename.txt OR ./greedyTSP.exe filename.txt
        (CHRISTOFIDES) ./christofides.exe filename.txt OR ./christofides.exe filename.txt

        (Program will automatically drop .txt from filename and create SVG)

4.  After TSP algorithm computes, to generate the SVG solution it will prompt you for the original grid size of the data.
        Enter this value so that the SVG can scale correctly and draw the solution.

5.  Program should be done running and you can view the solution on screen or if you prefer a visual, open the SVG file
